What is JavaScript?
Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and 
most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow 
client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an 
interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to 
JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. 
JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the
name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been 
embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript 
language.

 JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
 Designed for creating network-centric applications.
 Complementary to and integrated with Java.
 Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
 Open and cross-platform.

Client-Side JavaScript

Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script 
should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be 
interpreted by the browser.
It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs 
that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML 
content.

The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional 
CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the 
user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.
The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all 
the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.
JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link 
navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.
